Datasets of natural and urban images

These datasets contain photographs from natural and urban scenes, and can be 
used freely when acknowledging Joris Bleys and Tony  Belpaeme.

The natural dataset contains 300 digital or digitised photographs of natural 
scenes. The images contain a selection of flora and fauna. The images are of 
different sizes (ranging from 240 by 180 pixels to 1152 by 864 pixels). They 
were collected from the internet and are available as JPG/BMP files. Note that 
the JPG format tends to reduce the chromatic content by compressing the 
chromatic u and v channels in the Yuv representation is uses.

The urban dataset contains 278 digital photographs of urban scenes. The images 
contain scenes from Brussels and Ghent, taken in October and November of 2003. 
The images are available as uncompressed TIFF files; the chromatic channels 
have not been compressed. The photos were made with an Olympus 4000C ZOOM 
digital camera.
